Purpose
=======

Wouldn't it be funny to try to use an FTP server as a proxy server for peer-to-peer communication? Well, the purpose of this project is *just that*! My library, *FTPProxy*, will make it possible and easy to create a one-directional data stream between two remote machines using an FTP server as a proxy. The protocol itself will involve creating and deleting files on the FTP server, which is obviously not very efficient, but it *is* original.
